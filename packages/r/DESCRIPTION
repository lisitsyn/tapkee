Description: Provides an R interface to the Tapkee C++ library for
    dimensionality reduction. Implements over 20 algorithms including Isomap,
    Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), t-SNE, PCA, Kernel PCA, Multidimensional
    Scaling (MDS), Diffusion Maps, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Factor Analysis,
    and more. All algorithms are implemented in C++ and accessed through
    a single function.

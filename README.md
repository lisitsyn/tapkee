Tapkee is a C++ template library for dimensionality reduction with some bias on
spectral methods. The Tapkee origins from the code developed during
[GSoC 2011](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) as
the part of the [Shogun machine learning toolbox](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun).
The project aim is to provide efficient and flexible standalone library for
dimensionality reduction which can be easily integrated to existing codebases.
Tapkee leverages capabilities of effective [Eigen3 linear algebra library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) and
optionally makes use of the [ARPACK eigensolver](http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/).
The library uses CoverTree and VP-tree data structures to compute nearest neighbors. To achieve
greater flexibility we provide a callback interface which decouples dimension reduction algorithms from
the data representation and storage schemes.

The library is distributed under permissive
[BSD 3-clause license](https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/include/LICENSE)
(except a few rather optional parts that are distributed under other
open sources licenses, see Licensing section of this document). If you use
this software in any publication we would be happy if you cite the following paper:

	Sergey Lisitsyn and Christian Widmer and Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia. Tapkee: An Efficient Dimension Reduction Library. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 14: 2355-2359, 2013.

To get started with dimension reduction you may try the
[go.py script](https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/examples/go.py)
that embeds common datasets (swissroll, helix, scurve) using
the Tapkee library and outputs it with the help of
Matplotlib library. To use the script build the
sample application (see the Application section for more details)
and call go.py with the following command:

	./examples/go.py [swissroll|helix|scurve|...] [lle|isomap|...]

You may also try out an minimal example using `make minimal` (examples/minimal)
and the RNA example using `make rna` (examples/rna). There are also a few graphical
examples. To run MNIST digits embedding example use `make mnist` (examples/mnist),
to run promoters embedding example use `make promoters` (examples/promoters)
and to run embedding for faces dataset use `make faces` (examples/faces).
All graphical examples require Matplotlib which can be usually
installed with a package manager. The promoters example also
has non-trivial dependency on Shogun machine learning toolbox
(minimal version is 2.1.0). We also provide
some examples of usage Tapkee in Shogun as
`make langs` (examples/langs) example.

API
---

We provide an interface based on the method chaining technique. The chain starts from the call
of the `initialize()` method and followed with the `withParameters(const ParametersSet&)` call
which is used to provide parameters like the method to use and its settings. The provided
argument is formed with the following syntax:

	(keyword1=value1, keyword2=value2)

Such syntax is possible due to comma operator overloading which groups all assigned keywords
in the comma separated list.

Keywords are defined in the `tapkee` namespace. Currently, the following keywords
are defined: `method`, `eigen_method`, `neighbors_method`, `num_neighbors`, `target_dimension`,
`diffusion_map_timesteps`, `gaussian_kernel_width`, `max_iteration`, `spe_global_strategy`,
`spe_num_updates`, `spe_tolerance`, `landmark_ratio`, `nullspace_shift`, `klle_shift`,
`check_connectivity`, `fa_epsilon`, `progress_function`, `cancel_function`, `sne_perplexity`,
`sne_theta`. See the documentation for their detailed meaning.

As an example of parameters setting, if you want to use the Isomap
algorithm with the number of neighbors set to 15:

	tapkee::initialize().withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15))

Please note that the inner parentheses are necessary as it uses the
comma operator which appears to be ambiguous in this case.

Next, with initialized parameters you may either embed the provided matrix with:

	tapkee::initialize().withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15)).
	                    .embedUsing(matrix);

Or provide callbacks (kernel, distance and features) using any combination
of the `withKernel(KernelCallback)`, `withDistance(DistanceCallback)` and
`withFeatures(FeaturesCallback)` member functions:

	tapkee::initialize().withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15))
	                    .withKernel(kernel_callback)
	                    .withDistance(distance_callback)
	                    .withFeatures(features_callback)

Once callbacks are initialized you may either embed data using an
STL-compatible sequence of indices or objects (that supports the
`begin()` and `end()` methods to obtain the corresponding iterators)
with the `embedUsing(Sequence)` member function
or embed the data using a sequence range with the
`embedRange(RandomAccessIterator, RandomAccessIterator)`
member function.

As a summary - a few examples:

	TapkeeOutput output = initialize()
	    .withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15))
	    .embedUsing(matrix);

	TapkeeOutput output = initialize()
	    .withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15))
	    .withDistance(distance_callback)
	    .embedUsing(indices);

	TapkeeOutput output = initialize()
	    .withParameters((method=Isomap,num_neighbors=15))
	    .withDistance(distance_callback)
	    .embedRange(indices.begin(),indices.end());

Minimal example
---------------

A minimal working example of a program that uses the library is:

	#include <tapkee/tapkee.hpp>
	#include <tapkee/callbacks/dummy_callbacks.hpp>

	using namespace std;
	using namespace tapkee;

	struct MyDistanceCallback
	{
		ScalarType distance(IndexType l, IndexType r) { return abs(l-r); }
	};

	int main(int argc, const char** argv)
	{
		const int N = 100;
		vector<IndexType> indices(N);
		for (int i=0; i<N; i++) indices[i] = i;

		MyDistanceCallback d;

		TapkeeOutput output = tapkee::initialize()
		   .withParameters((method=MultidimensionalScaling,target_dimension=1))
		   .withDistance(d)
		   .embedUsing(indices);

		cout << output.embedding.transpose() << endl;
		return 0;
	}

This example require Tapkee to be in the include path. With Linux compilers
you may do that with the `-I/path/to/tapkee/headers/folder` key.

Integration
-----------

There are a few issues related to including the Tapkee library to your code. First, if your library
already includes Eigen3 (and only if) - you might need to let Tapkee
know about that with the following define:

`#define TAPKEE_EIGEN_INCLUDE_FILE <path/to/your/eigen/include/file.h>`

Please note that if you don't include Eigen3 in your project there is no need to define that variable -
in this case Eigen3 will be included by Tapkee. This issue comes from the need of including the Eigen3 library
only once when using some specific parameters (like debug and extensions).

If you are able to use less restrictive licenses (such as LGPLv3) you may define
the following variable:

- `TAPKEE_USE_LGPL_COVERTREE` to use Covertree code by John Langford.

When compiling your software that includes Tapkee be sure Eigen3 headers are in include path and your code
is linked against ARPACK library (-larpack key for g++ and clang++).

For an example of integration you may check
[Tapkee adapter in Shogun](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/lib/tapkee/tapkee_shogun.cpp).

When working with installed headers you may check which version of the library
do you have with checking the values of `TAPKEE_WORLD_VERSION`, `TAPKEE_MAJOR_VERSION`
and `TAPKEE_MINOR_VERSION` defines.

We welcome any integration so please contact authors if you have got any questions. If you have
successfully used the library please also let authors know about that - mentions of any
applications are very appreciated.

Customization
-------------

Tapkee is designed to be highly customizable with preprocessor definitions.

If you want to use float as internal numeric type (default is double) you may do
that with definition of `#define TAPKEE_CUSTOM_NUMTYPE float`
before including [defines header](https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/include/tapkee_defines.hpp).

If you use some non-standard STL-compatible realization of vector, map and pair you may redefine them
with `TAPKEE_INTERNAL_VECTOR`, `TAPKEE_INTERNAL_PAIR`, `TAPKEE_INTERNAL_MAP`
(they are set to std::vector, std::pair and std::map by default otherwise).

You may define `TAPKEE_USE_FIBONACCI_HEAP` or `TAPKEE_USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE` to select which
data structure should be used in the shortest paths computing algorithm. By default
a priority queue is used.

Other properties can be loaded from some provided header file using `#define TAPKEE_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES`. Currently
such file should define only one variable - `COVERTREE_BASE` which defines the base of the CoverTree (default is 1.3).

Command line application
-----------

Tapkee comes with a sample application which can be used to construct
low-dimensional representations of dense feature matrices. For more information on
its usage please run:

`./bin/tapkee_cli -h`

The application takes plain ASCII file containing dense matrix (each vector is a column and each
line contains values of some feature). The output of the application is stored into the provided
file in the same format (each line is feature).

To compile the application please use [CMake](http://cmake.org/). The workflow of compilation
Tapkee with CMake is usual. When using Unix-based
systems you may use the following command to compile the Tapkee application:

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake [definitions] .. && make`

There are a few cases when you'd want to put some definitions:

- To enable unit-tests compilation add to `-DBUILD_TESTS=1` to `[definitions]` when building. Please note that
  building unit-tests require googletest. If you are running Ubuntu you may install `libgtest-dev` package for that.
  Otherwise, if you have gtest sources around you may provide them as `-DGTEST_SOURCE_DIR` and `-DGTEST_INCLUDES_DIR`.
  You may also download gtest with the following command:

`wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz && tar xfv release-1.8.0.tar.gz`

  Downloaded sources will be used by Tapkee.
  To run tests use `make test` command (or better 'ctest -VV').

- To let make script store test coverage information using GCOV and
  add a target for output test coverage in HTML with LCOV add the `-DUSE_GCOV=1` flag to `[definitions]`.

- To enable precomputation of kernel/distance matrices which can speed-up algorithms (but requires much more memory) add
  `-DPRECOMPUTED=1` to `[definitions]` when building.

- To build application without parts licensed by LGPLv3 use `-DGPL_FREE=1` definition.

The library requires Eigen3 to be available in your path. The ARPACK library is also highly
recommended to achieve best performance. On Debian/Ubuntu these packages can be installed with

	sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libarpack2-dev

If you are using Mac OS X and Macports you can install these packages with

	sudo port install eigen3 && sudo port install arpack`

In case you want to use some non-default
compiler use `CC=your-C-compiler CXX=your-C++-compiler cmake [definitions] ..` when running cmake.

Directory contents
------------------

The repository of Tapkee contains the following directories:

- `src/` that contains simple command-line application (`src/cli`)
  and CMake module finders (`src/cmake`).
- `includes/` that contains the library itself in the `includes/tapkee`
  subdirectory.
- `test/` that contains unit-tests in the `test/unit` subdirectory and
  a few helper scripts.
- `examples/` that contains a few examples including already mentioned
  (these examples are supposed to be called through `make` as described
   above, e.g. `make minimal`).
- `data/` a git submodule that contains data required for
  examples. To initialize this submodule use `git submodule update --init`.
- `doc/` that contains Doxygen interface file which is used to
  generate HTML documentation of the library. Calling
  `doxygen doc/Doxyfile` will generate it in this folder.

Once built, the root will also contain the following directories:
- `bin` that contains binaries (`tapkee_cli` that is command line application
  and various tests with common naming `test_*`)
- `lib` that contains gtest shared libraries.
